Roses are RED,
Violets are BLUE,
I want to eat pasta,
In one Mazda.

Hungrier am i,
Pizza will find,
Runing to shop to buy,
No pizza to see,
Tacos more easier to find.

Pass When you least expect it
You raise Without thinking much
You enjoy the As a teenager
Until suddenly you feel that car
If it is to be a pure party
You must know your partner
And propose a walk through the forest.

Estas Lineas no contienen verso,
solo es algo perso.
